# Long Double Output Bug In MinGW

This repository is for my [post on a bug](http://www.diusrex.com/2015/05/long-double-bug-in-mingw/) I found in g++ 4.8.1 revision 4 distributed by MinGW-get. 

Please note, however, that much of the code is implementation specific, and could not be correct for your compiler, even if it is g++.
